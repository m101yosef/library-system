# Library System 
- The system should allow a library to store books, register users, and manage borrowing and returning of books.
- Different types of users (students, teachers) should follow different rules (borrowing limits, for example).
- The project should demonstrate OOP concepts:
  - Encapsulation → hiding book availability details.
  - Inheritance → students and teachers both inherit from a general user.
  - Polymorphism → each user type borrows books differently.
  - Abstraction → a base abstract class User that enforces a common interface.
- Students will also learn about design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Strategy) in a practical way.
- Finally, they will write tests to check that the system works correctly.
